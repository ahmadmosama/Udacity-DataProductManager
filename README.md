PART I:

Flying Taxi Business Case [Final]:
You’ve performed a lot of analysis on existing data and looked into the user research survey data for a flying car service, so now it’s time to come up with a product objective and KPIs, determine an MVP, and decide on how to assess the KPIs and gather feedback. Now, you’ll leverage your research from Part 1 and your other work here to create your product proposal.

All of your work should be done inside of the slide deck you created in the Midterm.

You will complete the tasks below, as per the project rubric:

Identifying KPIs and deciding on an MVP

1. Identify a product objective for Flyber's launch. Your product objective will guide your KPIs, so identify what Flyber should optimize for. Your objective should be centered around one of the following focus areas:
- User Acquisition
- User Engagement
- User Retention
- Profitability
- Explain your reasoning. Include both why you feel your focus area is more relevant than the others for Flyber at this time of the product development cycle.
2. Formulate your KPIs
3. Determine your hypotheses (where your KPIs need to go in order to determine product success)
4. Determine the sample sizes & time period needed to come to a conclusion on your hypotheses
5. Create an instrumentation plan for the events you need collected and logged
6. Create a qualitative feedback survey mechanism for users after their ride

Creating the full Product Proposal

7. Identify the target population. Why did you select that target population? What are their pain points?
8. Create a product proposal containing claims, evidence, and impact.
9. Claims should be backed by evidence, and impact statements assess market needs/benefits and risks.
10. In your risk analysis, note any other departments that should be involved.
11. State any known unknowns around ensuring a successful product launch


PART II:

Project Instructions
Flyber, the first flying taxi service in New York City has been massively successful. The original data pipelines to receive and process the customer events are unable to keep up. You have been tasked to come up with a data strategy to not only handle this massive amount of data but also process it to get the business insights they need to run and grow their business. Using the skills you have learned in this course, you will:

1. Identify primary data stakeholders and their data needs.
2. Understand how data can be modeled or organized to support data business needs.
3. Perform ETL.
4. Choose relevant data sets to answer business questions.
5. Optional Create visualizations to understand the scale of data growth.
6. Analyze data to address Flyber's Data Growth Rate.
7. Choose Data Infrastructure strategy for Flyber.

Getting Started:
You can find all of the materials needed for the project in the Project Resources Section of the classroom

Start With the Template Flyber Data Strategy.

All project instructions details are included in this file. There are also links to the data files you would need to complete part 3 and the optional part 5. These files can also be downloaded from the Project Resources section of the classroom.

Section 1 and 2 focus on stakeholders and what data they need. Section 3, 4, 5, and 6 focus on understanding the scalability needs. Section 7 is all about suggesting a Data Infrastructure strategy based on analysis of all the previous sections.
